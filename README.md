Sri (Scalajs React interface) is a scalajs library to build truly native cross platform (mobile (ios and android) and web) applications. It is based on [reactjs](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), so you must be familiar with them in order to use this library.
